<h4 style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color: white;"><a href="http://www.cammomusic.org/cammo-offers/music-therapy/what-is-music-therapy?gclid=CjwKCAiAjrXxBRAPEiwAiM3DQs9RW-OFZJ6VRG05SVvdEOrkIGYW5Y7cz4tlRaTlPZu6u_nxi0YO4xoCDvoQAvD_BwE" target="blank">Music therapy</a> is an intervention sometimes utilized to promote emotional health, help patients cope with stress, and boost psychological well-being. Some research even suggests that your taste in music can provide insight into different aspects of your personality.</h4>
<p>It can help:</p>
<ul>
    <li>build new neural connections in the brain</li>
    <li>improve rehabilitate potential</li>
    <li>enhance the ability of the brain to "rewire"itself after trauma or injury</li>
</ul>
<p>Relaxing music can alleviate stress by lowering cortisol levels, which is the hormone released in response to stress. This will be more effective when listening to instumental music, which is refered to as "brain food", than songs with lyrics. </p>
